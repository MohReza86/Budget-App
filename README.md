## Budget App

Using object-oriented programming, the algorithm instantiates objects based on different budget categories 
like food, clothing, and entertainment. When objects are created, they are passed in the name of the category.

The Budget class can handle different transcactions, including deposit, withdraw, tranfer to other budget 
categories and balance check. 

When the budget object is printed it will display:

*************Food*************
initial deposit        1000.00
groceries               -10.15
restaurant and more foo -15.89
Transfer to Clothing    -50.00
Total: 923.96

It will also create a chart a bar chart based on the percentage spent in each category, as follows:
